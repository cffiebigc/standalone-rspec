= Standalone RSpec Integration Test Suite

== Introduction

This works is inspired by the idea of https://github.com/thuss/standalone-cucumber. Thanks Todd !

Use this test project layout when you want to test a site that is not rails/sinatra/ruby powered and thus with no comfortable test framework.

To switch to use your own development or staging server adjust the URL in spec_helper.rb. I have this example project setup to use Capybara with Webdriver (Selenium) and poltergeist but you can easily switch this to use Culerity, Webrat, env-js by editing spec_helper.rb.

Pull requests with updates/enhancements/bug fixes are always welcome!
